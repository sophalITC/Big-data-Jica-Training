Step 1. install miniconda
https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
At the above link you can choose the version that is right for your PC (based on your OS -- if you use windows, probably the first one: miniconda3 64bit windows)
download the installer, and then run the installer, to install miniconda. (accept all defaults, except if you know you want to change them)

Step 2. Open the new program    'Anaconda Prompt'    program that was installed. 
In this prompt write each line followed by 'enter'  each time it might ask y/n if that happens, type y and click enter again.

conda create --name dsm_env python=3.9              (then click enter)

conda activate dsm_env			        (then click enter)

conda install -c conda-forge notebook scipy matplotlib rasterio opencv         (then click enter)

# Step 2 option 2 (if option 1 didn't work) 
in shared folder JICA-big-data-course
download the file called env_dsm2dtm.yml

then in anaconda prompt put this
conda env create -f <path-to-file>

(<path-to-file> should be the file path to where you saved the .yml file. for example, if I saved it in downloads on windows, I can write this)
conda env create -f "C:\Users\user\Downloads\env_dsm2dtm.yml"

then type 
conda activate dsm2dtm
