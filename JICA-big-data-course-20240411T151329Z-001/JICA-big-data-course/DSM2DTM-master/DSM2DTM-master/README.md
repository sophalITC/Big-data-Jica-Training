# DSM2DTM

Notes: 


A) This is a Python based implementation of "ADVANCED DTM GENERATION FROM VERY HIGH RESOLUTION SATELLITE STEREO IMAGES" by Perko et al (2015).
https://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/II-3-W4/165/2015/isprsannals-II-3-W4-165-2015.pdf
This code is a modification of Perko et al (2015) to suit coarse resolution DSM e.g. ASTER, AW3D30.

B) This runs on Python 2.7. Also download get_DSM.py and classDSM.py in the same folder. Make that folder as the active folder.

C) To run, type in terminal:

python get_nDSM.py  --inputDSMpath 'path/for_trial.tif'  --outputnDSMpath 'outfilesample.tif'  --img_resolution 30  --neighborhood_kernel 300  --height_threshold 3  --slope_threshold 60

D) Help options:

python get_nDSM.py -h

E) Varibale decription

 img_resolution is the resolution in meters. e.g. SRTM it should be 90. Regarding other optional arguments:
 
  1)
  
  --inputDSMpath INPUTDSMPATH
                        full path to DSM file which needs to be converted.
                        e.g. \home\AW3D.tif
                        
  2)               
  
  --outputnDSMpath OUTPUTNDSMPATH
                        full path to output nDSM file after converted e.g.
                        \home\AW3Dout.tif
                        
  3)      
  
  --img_resolution IMG_RESOLUTION
                        image resolution in meter
                        
   4)           
   
  --neighborhood_kernel NEIGHBORHOOD_KERNEL
                        how far (in meter) should the kernel size be considered.
                        Recommended - Lower distance for higher resolution.
                        
   5)                     
   
  --height_threshold HEIGHT_THRESHOLD
                        minimum height difference (in meter) between ground
                        and building. Generally height of 1 storey building.
                        
   6)                     
   
  --slope_threshold SLOPE_THRESHOLD
                        minimum slope between a building and ground pixel (in
                        degrees)
                        
                        

F) Please also ensure that following modules are present:
Rasterio               #(Install by: pip install rasterio)
Cv2
Scipy
Numpy
Math
Matplotlib
